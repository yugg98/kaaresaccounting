      <p>
        When an individual or company earns income in a foreign country, they
        may be subject to taxation in both the foreign country and their home
        country. This can result in double taxation and can discourage
        cross-border trade and investment. To eliminate double taxation of the
        same income in both countries, countries enter into DTAA agreements.
